# PDF-Data-Extraction-Application 
A Python-based application that extracts data from customer-filled PDF forms, converts the extracted data into structured formats such as Excel or CSV, and handles images within the PDF. This project was developed as part of a hackathon to solve a real-world problem .

## Features 
Accurately extracts text and selection marks from PDF forms 
Identifies and interprets tick marks, cross marks, and shaded boxes to determine selected options 
Handles and processes images within the PDF using OCR technology 
Converts extracted data into structured formats such as Excel or CSV 
Supports multi-language text extraction and processing 
Uses machine learning models to recognize and interpret marks on forms 
Integrates with the Gemini API (if applicable) for additional processing needs 
Includes a simple user interface using Flask to upload PDFs and download processed files 

## Technologies Used 
Python 3.x 
PyPDF2 for PDF text extraction 
Pillow and OpenCV for image processing 
pytesseract for OCR 
pandas for data manipulation and conversion to Excel/CSV 
TensorFlow or PyTorch for machine learning 
Flask for frontend development 
Gemini API (if applicable) for API integration
